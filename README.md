## Deployment

### Deploy to Render (Free Tier)

This app is configured for easy deployment to Render's free tier.

#### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Render account (https://render.com)
- Anthropic API key (https://console.anthropic.com/)

#### Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to https://render.com/dashboard
   - Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will detect the `render.yaml` file and create two services:
     - `taigi-backend` (Python web service)
     - `taigi-frontend` (Static site)

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Go to the `taigi-backend` service dashboard
   - Navigate to "Environment" tab
   - Add environment variable:
     - Key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - Value: Your Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Add environment variable:
     - Key: `FLASK_ENV`
     - Value: `production`

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Backend: Installs Python dependencies and starts with Gunicorn
   - Frontend: Builds React app and deploys static files
   - First deployment takes 5-10 minutes

5. **Update API routing (if needed):**
   - The `render.yaml` is configured to route `/api/*` requests from the frontend to the backend
   - Backend URL will be: `https://taigi-backend.onrender.com`
   - Frontend URL will be: `https://taigi-frontend.onrender.com`

#### Important Notes

- **Free tier limitations:**
  - Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - First request after spin-down will take 30-60 seconds
  - 750 hours/month free tier (sufficient for one service running 24/7)

- **Audio caching:**
  - 3-tier caching system: In-memory → Supabase → Hapsing API
  - Optional Supabase integration for persistent cloud caching
  - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` to backend environment variables for faster audio
  - Without Supabase: In-memory cache resets on spin-down
  - First audio request may be slow (10-20 seconds) without Supabase cache

- **API costs:**
  - Anthropic Claude API usage is billed separately
  - Monitor usage at https://console.anthropic.com/

### Alternative: Deploy Locally for Testing

Build and test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Set environment variables
export FLASK_ENV=production
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn backend.app:app
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000
