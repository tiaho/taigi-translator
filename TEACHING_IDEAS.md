This document contains ideas for educational features to add to the Taiwanese translator app.

## Priority Features

### 1. Interactive Flashcard System ⭐ (Easiest to implement, most useful)

- Practice common "false friends" between the languages
- Multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank format

**Common Vocabulary Pairs to Focus On:**

- Build a learning streak (consecutive days)
- Push notifications or reminders (if PWA)
- Progress badges (7-day streak, 30-day streak, 100-word milestone)
- Leaderboard (optional, social feature)

**Implementation:**
- Daily phrase from curated list or generated by Claude
- localStorage for streak tracking

---

### 6. Sentence Builder Practice
**Learn grammar and word order through interactive exercises:**
- Drag-and-drop words to form correct sentences
- Practice word order differences (是真好 vs 真是好)

- Start with simple sentences, progress to complex
- Focus on grammar differences between Taiwan Mandarin and Taiwanese

**Key Grammar Points:**

- Question formation differences
- Verb placement

**Implementation:**
- Claude generates sentence variations
- Drag-and-drop UI with react-dnd or similar
- Grammar rule explanations on incorrect answers

---

### 7. Pronunciation Practice with Recording
**Record and compare user pronunciation:**
- Record user's pronunciation of Taiwanese phrases
- Compare waveform/pitch to native audio
- Tone visualization (show tone curves: high, rising, falling, etc.)
- Specific practice for difficult sounds (oo vs o͘, nasalization, tones)
- Feedback on tone accuracy

**Implementation:**
- Web Audio API for recording
- Visual waveform comparison
- Tone detection algorithm (challenging - may need library)
- Alternative: simpler "listen and repeat" without analysis

---

### 8. Study Sessions with Progress Tracking
**Structured learning sessions:**
- Timed learning sessions (10 min, 20 min, 30 min)
- Mix of translation, audio, romanization exercises
- Track statistics: words learned, accuracy %, time studied
- Weekly/monthly progress reports
- Export progress data (CSV, JSON)
- Graphs showing learning curve

**Metrics to Track:**
- Total words learned
- Accuracy by quiz type
- Study time per day/week/month
- Streak length
- Most challenging words
- Strong vs weak categories

**Implementation:**
- Session management state
- Database/localStorage for historical data
- Chart.js or similar for visualizations

### 9. Contextual Learning Modules
**Thematic lessons for real-world usage:**
- Pre-built lesson modules:
  - At the restaurant (點菜)
  - At the market (買菜)
  - Family gatherings (家庭聚會)
  - Greetings and introductions
  - Weather and seasons
  - Numbers and counting
  - Time and dates
- Mini-dialogues with both Taiwan Mandarin and Taiwanese versions

### 10. Word Association Game
**Build vocabulary networks:**
- Show a Taiwanese word → find related words from MOE dictionary
- Uses existing dictionary definitions and synonyms
- Build vocabulary networks (synonyms, related concepts)
- Example: 跤踏車 → synonyms: 孔明車, 自轉車, 鐵馬
- Gamified with points/levels
- Discover new words through associations

**Implementation:**
- Use MOE Dictionary's synonym data
- Graph visualization of word relationships (optional)
- Point system for finding connections

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage Options
1. **localStorage:** Simple, client-side, survives page refresh
   - Good for: flashcards, progress tracking, preferences
   - Limits: ~5-10MB, no sync across devices

2. **Backend Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB):** Server-side storage
   - Good for: user accounts, cross-device sync, leaderboards
   - Requires: authentication system, backend API endpoints

3. **Hybrid Approach:** localStorage + optional cloud sync
   - Start with localStorage only
   - Add backend sync as future feature

### Authentication
- **Not required initially:** Start with localStorage only
- **Future:** Add optional accounts for cloud sync
  - OAuth (Google, Facebook)
  - Email/password
  - Anonymous mode still available

### Mobile Considerations
- All features should work on mobile browsers
- Touch-friendly UI for drag-and-drop
- PWA (Progressive Web App) for installable app experience
- Offline mode for flashcard review
