# Teaching Tool Ideas for TaigiApp

This document contains ideas for educational features to add to the Taiwanese translator app.

## Priority Features

### 1. Interactive Flashcard System ⭐ (Easiest to implement, most useful)
**Description:** Convert any translation into a flashcard for spaced repetition learning.

**Features:**
- Front: English or Taiwan Mandarin
- Back: Taiwanese + Tâi-lô romanization + audio
- Spaced repetition algorithm (SRS) to optimize learning
- Track word status: "learning", "known", "mastered"
- Filter by difficulty or topic
- localStorage persistence (survives page refresh)

**Implementation:**
- Add "Save to Flashcards" button on translation results
- New flashcard review page/modal
- Simple SRS: show cards due for review based on last review date + interval
- Export/import flashcard decks

**Benefits:**
- Leverages existing translation API and audio system
- Simple UI addition
- High educational value

### 2. Vocabulary Difference Trainer ⭐⭐ (Unique to dual translation system)
**Description:** Specifically teach the differences between Taiwan Mandarin (國語) and Taiwanese (台語) vocabulary.

**Features:**
- Show Taiwan Mandarin word → ask for Taiwanese equivalent
- Examples: 腳踏車 → 跤踏車, 很 → 真/誠/足, 吃 → 食
- Explain why vocabulary differs (historical, cultural context)
- Practice common "false friends" between the languages
- Multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank format

**Common Vocabulary Pairs to Focus On:**
- bicycle: 腳踏車 (TW Mandarin) vs 跤踏車 (Taiwanese)
- very/really: 很/真的 (TW Mandarin) vs 真/誠/足 (Taiwanese)
- eat: 吃 (TW Mandarin) vs 食 (Taiwanese)
- fun/play: 好玩 (TW Mandarin) vs 好耍/好sńg (Taiwanese)
- foot/leg: 腳 (TW Mandarin) vs 跤 (Taiwanese)

**Implementation:**
- Database/JSON of common vocabulary pairs with explanations
- Quiz interface with immediate feedback
- Progress tracking for each vocabulary pair
- Claude API could generate explanations for differences

**Benefits:**
- NO OTHER APP DOES THIS

### 3. Tone Sandhi Trainer ⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced, unique to Taiwanese)
**Description:** Practice tone changes in Taiwanese compound words (tone sandhi).

**Features:**
- Practice tone changes when characters combine
- Visual representation of tone sandhi rules
- Examples: 跤 (kha) + 踏 (ta̍h) → kha-ta̍h-tshia (bicycle)
- Progressive difficulty (2-character → 3-character → phrases)
- Audio comparison (individual characters vs compound word)

**Why It's Important:**
- Tone sandhi is unique to Taiwanese (not in Mandarin)
- Critical for proper pronunciation
- Most learners struggle with this
- Few resources teach it effectively

**Implementation:**
- Use MOE Dictionary data for correct tone sandhi
- TauPhahJi provides proper hyphenation
- Audio from Hapsing API for both individual and compound
- Visual tone curves/diagrams

**Benefits:**
- Fills a major gap in Taiwanese learning resources
- Advanced feature that could become standout feature

## Additional Feature Ideas

### 4. Quiz Modes
**Multiple quiz types for varied learning:**
- **Translation quiz:** English → choose correct Taiwanese (multiple choice)
- **Romanization quiz:** Hear audio → type Tâi-lô spelling
- **Listening comprehension:** Audio → choose correct meaning
- **Fill-in-the-blank:** Complete sentences with vocabulary words
- **Character recognition:** Taiwanese characters → romanization

**Implementation:**
- Generate quiz questions from saved flashcards or translation history
- Claude API could generate fill-in-the-blank sentences

---

### 5. Daily Challenge / Streak System
**Gamification to encourage consistent practice:**
- One phrase per day to learn
- Build a learning streak (consecutive days)
- Push notifications or reminders (if PWA)
- Progress badges (7-day streak, 30-day streak, 100-word milestone)
- Leaderboard (optional, social feature)

**Implementation:**
- Daily phrase from curated list or generated by Claude
- localStorage for streak tracking
- Simple badge/achievement system

---

### 6. Sentence Builder Practice
**Learn grammar and word order through interactive exercises:**
- Drag-and-drop words to form correct sentences
- Practice word order differences (是真好 vs 真是好)
- Visual feedback on correct/incorrect placement
- Start with simple sentences, progress to complex
- Focus on grammar differences between Taiwan Mandarin and Taiwanese

**Key Grammar Points:**
- Word order: 是 + 真/誠/足 + adjective (Taiwanese pattern)
- Particle usage: 的 in both languages
- Question formation differences
- Verb placement

**Implementation:**
- Claude generates sentence variations
- Drag-and-drop UI with react-dnd or similar
- Grammar rule explanations on incorrect answers

---

### 7. Pronunciation Practice with Recording
**Record and compare user pronunciation:**
- Record user's pronunciation of Taiwanese phrases
- Compare waveform/pitch to native audio
- Tone visualization (show tone curves: high, rising, falling, etc.)
- Specific practice for difficult sounds (oo vs o͘, nasalization, tones)
- Feedback on tone accuracy

**Implementation:**
- Web Audio API for recording
- Visual waveform comparison
- Tone detection algorithm (challenging - may need library)
- Alternative: simpler "listen and repeat" without analysis

---

### 8. Study Sessions with Progress Tracking
**Structured learning sessions:**
- Timed learning sessions (10 min, 20 min, 30 min)
- Mix of translation, audio, romanization exercises
- Track statistics: words learned, accuracy %, time studied
- Weekly/monthly progress reports

- Study time per day/week/month
- Streak length
- Most challenging words
- Strong vs weak categories

**Implementation:**
- Session management state
- Database/localStorage for historical data
- Chart.js or similar for visualizations

### 9. Contextual Learning Modules
**Thematic lessons for real-world usage:**
- Pre-built lesson modules:
  - At the restaurant (點菜)
  - At the market (買菜)
  - Family gatherings (家庭聚會)
  - Greetings and introductions
  - Weather and seasons
  - Numbers and counting
  - Time and dates
- Mini-dialogues with both Taiwan Mandarin and Taiwanese versions

---

### 10. Word Association Game
**Build vocabulary networks:**
- Show a Taiwanese word → find related words from MOE dictionary
- Uses existing dictionary definitions and synonyms
- Build vocabulary networks (synonyms, related concepts)
- Example: 跤踏車 → synonyms: 孔明車, 自轉車, 鐵馬
- Gamified with points/levels
- Discover new words through associations

**Implementation:**
- Use MOE Dictionary's synonym data
- Graph visualization of word relationships (optional)
- Point system for finding connections
- Leaderboard (optional)

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage Options
1. **localStorage:** Simple, client-side, survives page refresh
   - Good for: flashcards, progress tracking, preferences
   - Limits: ~5-10MB, no sync across devices

2. **Backend Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB):** Server-side storage
   - Good for: user accounts, cross-device sync, leaderboards
   - Requires: authentication system, backend API endpoints

3. **Hybrid Approach:** localStorage + optional cloud sync
   - Start with localStorage only
   - Add backend sync as future feature

### Authentication
- **Not required initially:** Start with localStorage only
- **Future:** Add optional accounts for cloud sync
  - OAuth (Google, Facebook)
  - Email/password
  - Anonymous mode still available

### Mobile Considerations
- All features should work on mobile browsers
- Touch-friendly UI for drag-and-drop
- PWA (Progressive Web App) for installable app experience
- Offline mode for flashcard review
